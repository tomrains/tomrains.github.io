Hi there, my name is Tom. In a past life, I wrote a ton of content. Now, I'm more into writing code. I'm familiar with the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- HTML/CSS
- Git
- Command line

I'm interested in learning more about other JS frameworks and databases, too.

### My story

Want to know even more about me? Okay. Buckle in.

I was born in 1991 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I have 4 siblings and 2 parents. 

Alright, now I'm about to get braggadocious (not a real word). In high school, I was a valedictorian and National Merit Scholar. I studied Spanish at the University of Oklahoma. I completed my degree in 5 semesters, but my scholarship lasted for 10 semesters, so I spent 4 more semesters getting a Master's in Professional Writing.

**Life in New York:** After school, I moved to New York City. I spent the first few months writing fiction and exploring the Big Apple. A few months later, I got a writing job with a company called BuildingLink. In my last year in New York, I lived in a [69-square-foot apartment](https://tomrains.me/2017/02/21/my-apartment-is-69-square-feet/) in the East Village. No, that wasn't a typo. It really was that small. Although I loved New York, after 2.5 years I decided it was time for a new adventure. I moved back to Tulsa.

**Tulsa and learning to code:** My first job in Tulsa was for a big company called Dentsply Sirona that sells dental equipment. I worked first as a marketing coordinator and then as a content specialist for the endodontics division (endodontics is the study and treatment of dental pulp, often involving root canals). I enjoyed my work, but I still wondered if content was really right for me. I started learning to code on the side. I discovered Github Pages and how easy it was to write vanilla JS in the browser. Hours flew by sometimes as I tinkered in the browser. Was coding the thing for me?

**Agile methodology and making an app:** After a year at Dentsply Sirona, I started looking for a more hip job closer to where I lived in downtown Tulsa. I found a cool company called ConsumerAffairs, essentially Consumer Reports' lesser known sibling. I worked as a content specialist there, which basically meant I wrote a lot and learned more about SEO than I thought was possible. The content team there followed Agile principles, and I was lucky enough to be able to lead our team retrospectives. I still learned to code in the evenings during the two years I worked at ConsumerAffairs, though I had my doubts. Could I really learn to code all on my own? I kept going, anyway.

**2020:** After working hard at ConsumerAffairs for 2 years and coding in the evenings and on weekends, I realized I had learned a lot and even made a half-decent full-stack MERN app. It was pretty easy to say my heart wasn't in content the same way it was before. In 2020, ConsumerAffairs went fully remote, I made massive progress learning to code, and, eventually, I got laid off in the middle of a pandemic.

Now I'm here, and you're also here. That's pretty cool. Can I help you solve a problem you're having? Do you want to work with me? I'd love to talk to you.
