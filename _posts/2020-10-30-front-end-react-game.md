My best trivia category is geography, and I love games, so when I was putting my React skills to the test, I decided to make a dynamic geography quiz game. [Play with it here](https://tomrains.github.io/populations-game/). 

The game makes you guess which country has the larger population. The choices are randomly generated, so you get a new quiz every time. (The chances of getting the same quiz is (insert math here).

Making this app helped me wrap my head around React state and props. I encountered some strange problems along the way, and looking back I'm proud of the novel (if unconventional) ways I fixed them.
