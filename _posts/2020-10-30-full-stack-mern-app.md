## So what is this app, anyway?
My [full-stack MERN app](https://secret-wildwood-99621.herokuapp.com/) is based on an old-school pen and paper activity called the Story Game. This digital version lets you:  
* Create outrageous, hilarious stories with friends
* Play either remotely or together (with your faces in your smartphones)
You'll need at least one friend to help you test the app out. If you want to learn more about how I built it and its technical capabilities, read on.

## How did you make the app?
I wanted to build a full-stack app. I already knew and loved React, so I opted for a MERN stack app.

## How did you get the idea for this app?
I've always loved the pen and paper version of the Story Game. I don't laugh easily, but this game often has me crying with laughter at the Kafkaesque stories that come out of it. Sometimes though, it's hard to read what people wrote, and I've learned some people don't really like writing with pen and paper, so I decided to make an app version, especially since I knew it would require a backend.

## What are the rules of the game?
First, you begin writing the first 135 to 150 characters of a story. You can't write more than 150. Then, you submit your story. Once all players have submitted, you will receive a story someone else has written, but you'll only be able to see the last few words they wrote. You'll have to continue the thread of the story based on this small amount of context. You'll do this for however many rounds the host chose (3, 5, 7, or 9). Once you've submitted for the last round, you'll receive a story written by several players. Hopefully, it makes you and everyone else laugh.

## Can you give me a full, exhaustive/exhausting breakdown of the technologies you used to make the app?
I'm so glad you asked. The answer is _yes._

## Can you show me how to make an app?
Yes. Just contact me via email or phone. I love helping people learning to code.
